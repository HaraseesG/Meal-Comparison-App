# Meal-Comparison-App
A very simple meal comparison app. The intention is to fully containerize this in a Kubernetes cluster with MYSQL and FastAPI running on Uvicorn and provide a framework to plan any meal. There will also be a method to extract the data as a CSV which can then be imported into other tools like Google Sheets for further analysis
